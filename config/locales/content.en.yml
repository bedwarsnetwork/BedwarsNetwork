      whats_bedwars: 'What is Bedwars?'
      whats_bedwars_text: "Bedwars is a minigame within Minecraft. You play on multiplayer servers on the Internet. In a round, there are several teams, all of which have the goal of surviving as the last team. Players can attack each other and kill, but appear again and again - as long as the team still has a bed. The goal is also to destroy the other team's bed, reducing the number of players on the other team. The team that has a player in the round wins."
